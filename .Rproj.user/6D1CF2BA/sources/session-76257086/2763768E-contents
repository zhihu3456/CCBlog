# Climate, Air Quality Research (CARE) Unit

## *When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.*

**Climate change** is the most important science issue of the 21st century, challenging the very structure of our global society. We are a group of researchers who are passionate about understanding the climate change and its impact on human health. Our research is mainly based on Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Research Network. Currently, we are focusing on the following research topics: landscape fire sourced-air pollution, tropical cyclone, floods and extreme weathers.
